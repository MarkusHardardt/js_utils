# js_utils

## Modules:

- [hmi_object](docs/hmi_object.md): This module allows the configuration of content with structured JavaScript objects without requiring detailed knowledge of HTML or CSS. The objects are analyzed for predefined properties and methods, and the respective page content is automatically generated. The entire life cycle of the objects is controlled, including a multi-stage construction phase, an update phase during the display, and, corresponding to the construction phase, a multi-stage dismantling phase.
